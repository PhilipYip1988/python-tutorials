<img src='./images/img_014.png' alt='img_014' width='600'/>

## Downloading and Installing VSCode

To view the formatted markdown, VSCode should be installed. VSCode is a general purpose code editor and has native markdown support. VSCode can be downloaded from the [VSCode Download Page](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). Select Windows (this will default to the User Installer):

<img src='./images/img_015.png' alt='img_015' width='600'/>

<img src='./images/img_016.png' alt='img_016' width='600'/>

Launch the VSCode setup:

<img src='./images/img_017.png' alt='img_017' width='600'/>

Accept the License Agreement and select Next:

<img src='./images/img_018.png' alt='img_018' width='600'/>

Select the default location and select Next:

<img src='./images/img_019.png' alt='img_019' width='600'/>

Select Next:

<img src='./images/img_020.png' alt='img_020' width='600'/>

Use the default options and select Next:

<img src='./images/img_021.png' alt='img_021' width='600'/>

Select Install:

<img src='./images/img_022.png' alt='img_022' width='600'/>

Select Finish:

<img src='./images/img_023.png' alt='img_023' width='600'/>

## Viewing Markdown Files

VSCode will launch, select File → Open Folder:

<img src='./images/img_024.png' alt='img_024' width='600'/>

Navigate to Python Tutorials and select Open:

<img src='./images/img_025.png' alt='img_025' width='600'/>

Select yes I Trust the Authors:

<img src='./images/img_026.png' alt='img_026' width='600'/>

Clicking on the `readme.md` will open the markdown editor:

<img src='./images/img_027.png' alt='img_027' width='600'/>

The table of contents display in the Outline:

<img src='./images/img_028.png' alt='img_028' width='600'/>

Right click the file and select Open Preview:

<img src='./images/img_029.png' alt='img_029' width='600'/>

This will display the formatted document:

<img src='./images/img_030.png' alt='img_030' width='600'/>

unfortunately the Outline is blank when the Preview is selected. The raw file and the preview can be opened side by side, allowing use of the outline:

<img src='./images/img_031.png' alt='img_031' width='600'/>

The file tab can be collapsed and the raw file tab closed, allowing more screen space for the content:

<img src='./images/img_032.png' alt='img_032' width='600'/>

It is recommended to read these tutorials using two screens. On one screen launch the Spyder IDE and on the other screen, use VSCode for the markdown preview.

Note it is possible to code with Python in VSCode but this requires installation of extensions and setup of a Python environment.
