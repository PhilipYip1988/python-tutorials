# Terminal

The Terminal was used to install Python, select a folder and launch a Python script. The Terminal uses a different programming language to Python called bash in Linux and Mac and a slightly different programming language called PowerShell in Windows. These Terminal based programming languages are specialised for file operations and therefore it is useful to have an understanding of these programming languages before getting started with Python. Beginners that delve right into Python often get confused because they are using the Terminal based programming language to change folder, to launch Python and to use a Python package manager and then using Python to write a program:

[bash Scripting - Linux and Mac](./002_linux_terminal/)

PowerShell has a lot of similarities with bash and in most cases uses the commands from bash as an alias for the equivalent commands in PowerShell.

It is also possible to install:

* The Windows Subsystem for Linux on Windows to get bash within Windows
* PowerShell for Linux to get PowerShell within Linux
