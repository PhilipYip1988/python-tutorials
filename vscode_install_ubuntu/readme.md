# VSCode Ubuntu Setup

VSCode is a general purpose code editor that can be configured for Python development. 

## Install VSCode

Open up Ubuntu Software and search for code:

<img src='./images/img_001.png' alt='img_001' width='600'/>

Select Install:

<img src='./images/img_002.png' alt='img_002' width='600'/>

VSCode is now installed:

<img src='./images/img_003.png' alt='img_003' width='600'/>

## Miniforge Installation and Setup

To develop in Python, a `conda-forge` environment is required. In order to use conda, Miniforge needs to be installed and in order for the `conda-forge` environment to be activated within VSCode correctly, `conda` needs to be initialised with the Terminal. This was previously covered in:

[Miniforge Install and Initialisation](../spyder_install_ubuntu/readme.md#miniforge-installation)

In order to use TeX in matplotlib plots. TeX needs to be installed system wide using the operating systems package manager (which was also previously covered in the above):

```bash
sudo apt-get install texlive-xetex texlive-fonts-recommended texlive-plain-generic cm-super dvipng
```

## Updating the conda Package Manager

The purpose of the `base` environment is to use the conda package manager to install packages in other Python environments. Before using the conda package manager, the conda package manager should be updated to the latest version:

```bash
conda update conda
```

<img src='./images/img_004.png' alt='img_004' width='600'/>

Since Miniforge is used, the default channel will be the community channel `conda-forge`:

<img src='./images/img_005.png' alt='img_005' width='600'/>

Input `y` in order to proceed with any changes. In this example the `conda` package manager is already up to date:

<img src='./images/img_006.png' alt='img_006' width='600'/>

<img src='./images/img_007.png' alt='img_007' width='600'/>

## Creating a VSCode conda-forge Environment

To create a new environment for VSCode the following command can be used:

```bash
conda create -n vscode-env notebook jupyter cython seaborn scikit-learn pyarrow sympy openpyxl xlrd xlsxwriter lxml sqlalchemy tabulate nodejs ipywidgets plotly pyqt ipympl isort autopep8 ruff black
```

<img src='./images/img_008.png' alt='img_008' width='600'/>

Since Miniforge is used, the default channel will be the community channel `conda-forge`:

<img src='./images/img_009.png' alt='img_009' width='600'/>

Input `y` in order to proceed:

<img src='./images/img_010.png' alt='img_010' width='600'/>

The Python environment is created:

<img src='./images/img_011.png' alt='img_011' width='600'/>

## Installing Extensions

VSCode is a general purpose code editor and can be configured with extensions. To the left hand side select extensions:

<img src='./images/img_012.png' alt='img_012' width='600'/>

<img src='./images/img_013.png' alt='img_013' width='600'/>

For Python development, the Python extension needs to be installed:

<img src='./images/img_014.png' alt='img_014' width='600'/>

Installing this extension will also install Pylance which is used for Python code completion and the Python debugger which is used for debugging. These three extensions are listed under the installed category:

<img src='./images/img_015.png' alt='img_015' width='600'/>

For interactive Python notebooks, the Jupyter extension can be installed:

<img src='./images/img_016.png' alt='img_016' width='600'/>

This installs Jupyter Keymaps, Notebook renderers, Cell Tags and Slideshow:

<img src='./images/img_017.png' alt='img_017' width='600'/>

Intellicode is additional code completion:

<img src='./images/img_018.png' alt='img_018' width='600'/>

isort is a formatter that sorts imports in Python:

<img src='./images/img_019.png' alt='img_019' width='600'/>

Code spell checker is an English spell checker:

<img src='./images/img_020.png' alt='img_020' width='600'/>

Python indent is used to help structure indented Python code:

<img src='./images/img_021.png' alt='img_021' width='600'/>

Python autodocstring is used to generate a template for docstrings:

<img src='./images/img_022.png' alt='img_022' width='600'/>

Indent rainbow is used to highlight indented Python code:

<img src='./images/img_023.png' alt='img_023' width='600'/>

Black is the black formatter:

<img src='./images/img_024.png' alt='img_024' width='600'/>

AutoPEP8 is the autopep8 formatter:

<img src='./images/img_025.png' alt='img_025' width='600'/>

Pylint gives additional Python linting:

<img src='./images/img_026.png' alt='img_026' width='600'/>

Ruff is the Ruff formatter and linter:

<img src='./images/img_027.png' alt='img_027' width='600'/>

Flake8 gives additional Python linting:

<img src='./images/img_028.png' alt='img_028' width='600'/>

Data wrangler is used to help visualise variables:

<img src='./images/img_029.png' alt='img_029' width='600'/>

It is recommended to close and reopen VSCode once installing the above extensions

## Project

When using VSCode, markdown files (normally a readme.md), script files and notebook files are grouped together in a folder, known as the project folder. Select Open Folder:

<img src='./images/img_030.png' alt='img_030' width='600'/>

In this case, the project folder is the Documents folder:

<img src='./images/img_031.png' alt='img_031' width='600'/>

Select open:

<img src='./images/img_032.png' alt='img_032' width='600'/>

Select Yes I trust the authors:

<img src='./images/img_033.png' alt='img_033' width='600'/>

## Selecting the Python Interpreter

To use Python with VSCode, the Python interpreter needs to be selected. This is similar to activating the conda environment. Press `Ctrl`+`â‡§`+`p` to open the command palette:

<img src='./images/img_034.png' alt='img_034' width='600'/>

Search for Python select interpreter: 

<img src='./images/img_035.png' alt='img_035' width='600'/>

Select the vscode-env created earlier:

<img src='./images/img_036.png' alt='img_036' width='600'/>

If a Python script is open in the file explorer:

```python
#%% Import Libraries
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
#%% Set Style
sns.set_style('whitegrid')
#%% Create Data
x = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
y = 2 * np.pi * np.sin(x)
#%% Plot
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.xlabel(R'$x$', usetex=True)
plt.ylabel(R'$x2 \pi x \sin{x}$', usetex=True)
plt.show()
```

<img src='./images/img_037.png' alt='img_037' width='600'/>

It displays in its own tab and can be run using the run button:

<img src='./images/img_038.png' alt='img_038' width='600'/>

Since this has the instruction `plt.show()`, the plot displays. Notice that the terminal is still busy while the plot displays, because it is waiting for the main window of the Qt application to close (the plot backend is qtagg):

<img src='./images/img_039.png' alt='img_039' width='600'/>

When this is closed, the new prompt displays. If the terminal in VSCode, is examined, note that the base Python environment is activated, however when the run button is used, the currently selected Python interpreter is used, which is the python binary in `vscode-env`. The full path to this Python binary is displayed in the terminal alongside the script file that was run:
