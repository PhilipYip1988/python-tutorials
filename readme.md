# Python Tutorials

This set of tutorials will look at the Python Programming Language using the markdown and notebook aspects of the JupyterLab IDE. All the tutorials are written in markdown with a large number of screenshots to help demonstrate the programming concepts and highlight interaction with the JupyterLab IDE. The code snippets can be copied and pasted or better typed into your own interactive notebook which you can open on your second monitor while reading through these markdown tutorials.

## Installation

The Python ecosystem is very large and has multiple package managers for third-party libraries and numerous IDEs available for writing Python code. This installation tutorial is very detailed as it explains how to use Python from the Terminal, the IDLE IDE, the Spyder IDE, the JupyterLab IDE and the Visual Code IDE and how to use the Mamba package manager to create Python Environments, examining what is going on behind the scenes in the file explorer.

## Markdown

The JupyterLab IDE has the ability to write formatted notes in a Markdown file. This tutorial will cover the basics of Markdown syntax. All of these tutorials are written using this basic Markdown syntax. It is also possible to use this knowledge in a Notebook with Markdown cells.

## Terminal

When running Python code from the Terminal, two programming languages are used. In Linux and Mac there is the inbuilt programming language bash and in Windows there is PowerShell which closely resembles bash. The bash programming language is optimised for basic file operations within the operating system and is commonly used in conjunction with Python. bash however uses a different programming syntax to Python and this tutorial will cover basic file operating systems using bash. Familarity with bash before delving into Python will prevent later confusion when using the terminal with Python commands.

## Python Builtins

Data is stored fundamentally as a text or as a number. This tutorial will examine the three types of number data types, boolean values which are True or False, whole numbers known as integers and floating point numbers in addition to the fundamental text data type, the string. The builtin identifiers for each of these datatypes will be examined:

[Fundamental Datatypes int, float, str, bool](./004_python_fundamental_datatypes/)

This tutorial looks at the practical applications of using numeric and text data types. It also examines how these data types are used with hardware to communicate with a user and highlights the differences in numbering systems used by humans versus the numbering systems used by computers and some important consequences when dealing with both these numbering systems:

[Understanding Numbering Systems](./005_numbering_systems/)

So far, only single text or numeric values have been considered. A collection can be used to group data. The string itself behaves as a collection as it is a collection of characters. This tutorial will examine the collection properties of the string, before moving onto the list, tuple, set and dictionary collections.

[Collections; str, list, tuple, set, dict](./006_collections/)

Indentation and spacing is very important in Python and code is often grouped into a code block. An analogy to not using indentation in Python, is not not use a steering wheel in a car. All the code so far has been run in a straight line going from start to finish. Indentation with a code block can be used to repeat code multiple times in a loop or to direct code in response to a condition.
