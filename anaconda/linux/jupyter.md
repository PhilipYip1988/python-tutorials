# Jupyter

Previously interactive Python ipython was examined and seen to contain Python code in addition to the bash based ipython magics. In addition ipython was seen to carry out syntax highlighting for Python code. The Jupyter project is a loose acronym for three programming languages **Ju**lia, **Pyt**on **et** (Latin for and) **R**, although this guide will only focus on Python where it is most commonly used. For Python, Jupyter essentially is an ecosystem around ipython. There are four binaries:

* [Jupyter Console (ipython)](./ipython.md)
* [Jupyter QTConsole](./jupyter_qtconsole.md)
* [Jupyter Notebook](./jupyter_notebook.md)
* [JupyterLab](./jupyterlab.md)
