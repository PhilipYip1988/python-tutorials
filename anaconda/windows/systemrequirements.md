# System Requirements

Minimum system requirements for Anaconda on Windows 11 are roughly on par with Microsoft's minimum system requirements for Windows 11. However for best results it is recommended to elevate these slightly to a medium specification computer around 5 years old or newer. In particular your system should be equipped with the following technologies:

* 10th Generation i5 Processor or AMD Ryzen 5 or newer
* UEFI BIOS (SMBIOS 3.0+) with Secure Boot
* 8 GB RAM 
* 256 GB SSD
* Graphics Card with a WDDM 2.0 Display Driver
* TPM 2.0
