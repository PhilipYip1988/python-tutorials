Why do we use ```self```, because it's a cultural norm and you want your Python to look like Python to other Python programmers but you could use any variable you want. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why even require us to put ```self``` shouldn't it be implicit and in some lanuages it is? I think this was an accidentally good design, my understanding is that he spent three months building the language with modules and functions and got it working fairly well but it wasn't all object orientated. He used up all his vacation and then later he's like oh I need to add in objects I believe it was dine in one day. What he did was, he indented all of the deaths, he took the functions that he already had and ran them in their own namespace. class is a namespace, if you actually cut the code and stick it in a seperate module and import it, it looks remarkably like the class dictionary. How many of you knew that what's inside is effectively a module? Did you know I can put print statements in the class definition and when you define the class it'll print, you can put for loops in there, you can actually alongside the defs, open and close files. Unbelieveable! This is against the rules in Java and C++, it's not Java and C++ just saying. So the way the class works is the defintions run as if they were in their own module and then the module dictionary becomes the class dictionary. \n",

A way to get to them was required and so the only programming that was necessary for that one day was to program the dot, the dotted lookup will reach inside of the class, find the function and take the first argument and fill in ```self``` for you.

No that's not advanced circle technology, we should use reusable components. Let's ```import``` ```from``` ```math``` and use ```math.pi```. In what ways is that better? One it makes sure we are goign to sue the same ```pi``` throughout our code, it's maximising code reuse but is ```pi``` a constant? How about it's a variable that never changes, there's actually a difference if you run this code on an old version of Python you'll get a 32-bit version of ```pi``` if you run it on a modern Python, you'll get a 64-bit version of ```pi``` and if you take the same program and upload it to a cray, it'll run out to a 128-bit version of ```pi```.

So yagni is something people used to toss around, is just a random acronymn but now it's part of the religion. The religion of laean start-up says don't put load down on your product initially, with a whole bunch of featires. All you're doing is spending your investors money without knowing whether the clients actually want the features. So part of the discipline is to stop throwing mountains of stuff into your classes. Start with a minimal possible. The moreyou throw in, the less agile you get. Should we throw in a whole bunch of things right now and give up our agility? No what should you do? Commit push and that's the agile part of it. The lean startup part of it is, I have MVP Minimum Viable Product. You ship the product, if it is not enough to check it in, you have to stick it in a customers hands early on to get some feedback, perhaps they don't need those stinking circles. It's Just saying. "

    "They actually cut several holes in one rubber sheet, so one rubber sheet has three cuts in it and they make three circles and they print them out and they said they had a colde area. What is all of this about? Well it turns out when you take rubber and heat it up, it stretches. So they did something we didn't expect, they changed the radius. After they changed the radius for the expansion of the rubber sheet, they recompute the area while warm. Was this an anticipated use case? No, I think it's hard to see this one coming basically if you expose an attribute, expect a user to do all kinds of itneresting things with it. If it's variable, it will change sooner or later. It is not a constant, in this case the radius of a circle was not constant during creation. How do you guys feel about exposing the radius at the time, so that the customers can both look at it and modify it? Who feels icky about that? Ah all of my Java and C++ programmers feel icky about it. Why? Because there is an ironclad rule in the Java and C++ rule and most other object-orientated language and that ironclad rule that you must follow is do not expose your attributes. What should you do instead? getter and setter methods, people don't get to access methods, but what would that do to our poor client. Look at this line here ```c.radius *= 1.1```, what would it have to turn into? They would have to do a ```c.getradius*1.1``` take the result of that and call ```c.set_radius()```. Isn't that awful looking code? It made our customers suffer for it. So let's just do things the Python way and the Pyton way is consenting adults language, leaving all the doors unlocked and hey we'll just risk whatever happens to us. Remember there's no private and protected in Python. How do feel about exposing your attributes? In Python, its common and normal. When you go back to the other languages, it's not common and normal and you absolutely must not expose your attributes because if you need to change the underlying implementation at some point, you are absolutely toast. You are locked into your client code and can't change. In Python do you expose your attributes. Yes. In other languages do you. Absolutely not. Different rules, don't let people impose Java rules when they are coding in Python and vice-versa, it is a common fault that people who get good at one language and check the rules of that language into another, these are completely different animals."

Now does the parent get called at all. Yes, we actually refer to it inside our perimeter, so we've intercepted the call and call our parent. If the parent eventually gets called, this action is called extending. If the parent doesn't get called, this action is called overriding. So we extend the parents methof, we let them the parent computer the perimeter and then we scale it up by 25% for the rubber. This is common and normal. You should expect every class you write. Somebody's going to subclass it and do something horrifying to one of your methods. Just saying, expect it. Is this common in the software field?

So what they need is a converter method because all they are interested in as a bounding box of the shape that's how the graphic company manipulates shapes. The properties like radius are something that applies to a particular shape. So they need something that will take their bounding box diagnonal and convert it to a radius.

They don't want to have to construct a circle from a radius, they want to construct it from a bounding box diagnonal. This is called a constructor war as constructor wars are typically fought as necessary with customers, they sometimes happen right away when you're first creating a class and when you have a constructor war, several people want different signatures for the constructor, the usual way is decided by who has the most power. Well I'm the leead, we will use bounding box diagnonal.

Some of you just like to count the days from the beginning of the Gregorian apocalyptic calendar, so you can use the days from that beginning of time to compute the ordinal. Or you can just ask for now. These are four different constructors from datetime. Now kind of speaks for itself, but the preposition here is typical in alternative constructors. ```dict.fromkeys``` is an alternative constructor to constructs a dictionary from a list of keys. "

The technique for doing that would be to provide an alternative constructor via a class method.

That way a person doesn't need the converter function, they just call the appropriate constructor, just like you would call ```datetime.fromtimestamp```, you can call ```Circle.frombbd``` and it will make a circle instance for you.

What about these tyre people, shouldn't they be able to call ```Tyre.from_bbd```? They should, but what our code will currenly do is call ```from_bbd``` which is hardwired to make a circle and not a tyre.

    "Alot of improvements, there is a problem though; you have to create an instance, just to call a function. A hint that you are doign something wrong, is that we pass in a variable called ```self``` do you see ```self``` used inside? There is nothing in this function that needs to know about an instance of the circle, this is an awkward API to call, and you're wasting a variable. What's the solution? A static method? The purpose of a static method is to attach functions to classes, probably you guys knew that but you couldn't articulate why you would do such a thing. You do it to find the findability of the function and to make sure that people are usign the function in the appropriate context ```Circle.angle_to_grade```. It is not used that often which is why most people don't know what it is for, so if you learn something new, you learn how to articulate its purpose. Why would you put a function in a class? In part because that's where people look for it. You put all the related tools in the toolbox."

    "I just wish I didn't have to change any code. I just wish whenever someone did a ```instance.radius``` look-up on an radius, that it would magically change to a get radius and everytime they set it ```instance.radius = value``` that it would magically change to a set radius. This can be done using ```property``` and what ```property``` does for you is after the fact, without changing any of the rest  of our code or any of our code or our client code, we can add this in and magically it will every time we set radius including in our own code this will no longer store in the instance variable, this will call this setter and actually store the diameter. This is why in Python you don't have to fear exposing your attributes, even if you never use property, it's a big win for you. Why because Python APIs are clean and beautiful, they don't have getters and setters everywhere in fact if you find yourself divided assigning a getter and setter, you are probably doing it wrong. All you're doing is making it awkward for your users to access. Dotted access is alot easier. If you actually need to make a change later after the fact, it's really easy to do by putting in a property. This is a big, big win in the Python programming language. When people come from C++ and Java, it's the hardest thing for them to give up, they just feel naked exposing their attributes. Like I get over it. If there's a problem later, we can just fix it by adding on a property and it's effortless. In the meantime your code looks very beautiful. Now you know what propeties is for you get a benefit from it even if you never use it. The benefit is every time you design a class, you don't have to put getters and setters in it and that'll make your classes shorter, it'll make them run faster and it'll make the APIs more beautiful. I think it's a big win, it's something you can do on a dynamic language. You can't do this in a compiled language, fair enough."

    "Yes its slots, if you pick up a design patterns book, this is called the flyweight design pattern, the flyweight design pattern says, when you have many, many, many instances make them leightweight and slots is a way to do it. What slots will do is say let's allocate just one pointer for the diameter and nothing else, no dictionary. You lose the ability to insepct the dictionary, you lose the ability to add additional attributes so this is just an optimisation, you always save it for last. Only when you are scaling up to a huge number of instances. So you implement the flyweight design pattern by saving it for last by putting in ```__slots__```, it suppresses the instance dictionary and it saves an enormous amount of memory and now your friends from acaademia are free to run 2 million circles without eating up all the memory on their machine. Do you do slots first or last. Last, because if you do slots first, you lose the ability to inspect the dictionary, you lose the ability to add new variables, all along the way but if you stick it in right at the end you get memory efficiency and memory efficiency on a modern machine is particularly important as we discussed in earlier talks. The cost of cache misses is as expensive as a floating-point divide and it'll slow down your code quite a bit."
