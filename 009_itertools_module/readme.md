# IterTools Module

## tuple Iterable and tuple Iterator

A collection is an iterable. For example:

```
archive = (1, True, 3.14, 'hello', 'hello', 'bye')
```

![img_001](./images/img_001.png)

This can be viewed in the Variable Explorer:

![img_002](./images/img_002.png)

![img_003](./images/img_003.png)

Notice it has 6 items and these are all shown simultaneously. If the directory of the iterable is examined, it has the \_\_iter\_\_ data model method:

```
from pprint import pprint
pprint(dir(archive), compact=True)
```

![img_004](./images/img_004.png)

This means the iter function can be used

```
forward = iter(archive)
forward
```

![img_005](./images/img_005.png)

On the Variable Explorer, the tuple_iterator instance has a size of 1. 

An iterator displays 1 value at a time:

![img_006](./images/img_006.png)

The next function can be used to read the next value and discard the previous value:

```
next(forward)
next(forward)
next(forward)
next(forward)
next(forward)
next(forward)
```

![img_007](./images/img_007.png)

The iterator was cast from a tuple that had a length of 6. Once next is called 6 times, the iterator is consumed. A StopIteration error displays if next is attempted to be called again:

```
next(forward)
```

![img_008](./images/img_008.png)

Alternatively if the iterator is cast into a tuple, all the elements in it are consumed:

```
forward = iter(archive)
tuple(forward)
```

![img_009](./images/img_009.png)

## Python builtins

Python builtins contains the most commonly used iterator classes. 

### zip

The zip class can be used to zip two or more collections together. Its initialization signature can be viewed by inputting zip() and pressing shift ⇧ and tab ↹:

![img_010](./images/img_010.png)

```
keys = ('r', 'g', 'b')
values = ('#FF0000', '#00FF00', '#0000FF')
forward = zip(keys, values)
forward
```

![img_011](./images/img_011.png)

This zip instance is an iterator that once again displays on the Variable Explorer with a length of 1 as it displays 1 value at a time, which in this case is a tuple:

![img_012](./images/img_012.png)

Each time next is called, a tuple of the zipped items displays:

```
next(forward)
next(forward)
next(forward)
```

![img_013](./images/img_013.png)

When two collections are zipped, they can be cast into a dict, doing so consumes all the values:

```
forward = zip(keys, values)
dict(forward)
```

![img_014](./images/img_014.png)

If zip is used on collections of multiple lengths, it stops zipping items once the shortest length collection has been consumed. names for example has an additional value yellow which is ignored:

```
names = ('red', 'green', 'blue', 'yellow')
keys = ('r', 'g', 'b')
values = ('#FF0000', '#00FF00', '#0000FF')
forward = zip(names, keys, values)
tuple(forward)
```

![img_015](./images/img_015.png)

### range Iterable and range Iterator

Earlier a tuple and a tuple_iterator was examined. The range class is iterable like a tuple but often gets confused with an iteratorbecause its common usage in for loops. It can be used to obtain an iterable of a numeric sequence. Its initialization signature can be viewed by inputting range() and pressing shift ⇧ and tab ↹:

![img_016](./images/img_016.png)

Its input arguments are of the type int:

* It can take in a single stop input argument. 

* Alternatively it can take a start and stop input argument.

* Alternatively it can take a start, stop and step input argument.

The input arguments are followed by a / indicating they are to be provided positionally only. If the start is not supplied it is assumed to be 0 and if the step is assumed to be 1. Python uses zero-order indexing and is inclusive of the lower bound and exclusive of the upper bound:

```
nums = range(3)
nums
```

![img_017](./images/img_017.png)

This displays on the Variable Explorer with the size of 3 and differs from the value of 1 shown for an iterator. The range class always has a stop value, and therefore is always an iterable of finite length. It has a size that can readily be computed and the \_\_len\_\_ data model identifier defined:

![img_018](./images/img_018.png)

```
forward.\_\_len\_\_()
len(forward)
```

![img_019](./images/img_019.png)

If next is called on it a TypeError is displayed stating that range is not an iterator:

```
next(nums)
```

![img_020](./images/img_020.png)

Both the tuple and range classes are iterable and can be cast into iterators using the iter function:

```
forward = iter(nums)
forward
```

![img_021](./images/img_021.png)

The range\_iterator instance is an iterator that once again displays on the Variable Explorer with a length of 1 as it displays 1 value at a time, which in this case is an int:

![img_022](./images/img_022.png)

```
next(forward)
next(forward)
next(forward)
```

![img_023](./images/img_023.png)

A for loop is normally used with a range instance:

```
for num in range(3):
    print(num)


```

![img_024](./images/img_024.png)

Under the hood, this uses a range\_iterator instance. It is worthwhile exploring the mechanics of the for loop using an infinite while loop. First is the instantiation of an iterator. next is called on this iterator within a nested try code block and in this case the int value of the iterator is printed. There is an associated except StopIteration block which breaks out of the while loop:

```
forward = iter(range(3))
while True:
    try:
        print(next(forward))
    except StopIteration:
        break
        
        
```

![img_025](./images/img_025.png)

This means all for loops are under the hood while loops which use nested try and except StopIteration code blocks. The former contains the code that would be placed in the for loop and the latter is designed for breaking out the while loop.

### map

The map class can be used to map a function call to a sequence. Its initialization signature can be viewed by inputting map() and pressing shift ⇧ and tab ↹:

![img_026](./images/img_026.png)

For example the lambda expression:

```
squared = lambda num: num ** 2
```

Can be mapped to the following sequence:

```
nums = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4)
```

An iterator that maps this function to this sequence can be created using:

```
forward = map(squared, nums)
```

![img_027](./images/img_027.png)

The map instance is an iterator that once again displays on the Variable Explorer with a length of 1 as it displays 1 value at a time, which in this case is the return value of the squared function call:

![img_031](./images/img_031.png)

When next is called, the next value in nums becomes num and is used for the input argument in the squared function call:

```
next(forward)
```

![img_028](./images/img_028.png)

```
next(forward)
```

![img_029](./images/img_029.png)

```
next(forward)
```

![img_030](./images/img_030.png)

All the function calls in the iterator can be consumed by casting to a tuple:

```
tuple(map(squared, nums))
```

![img_032](./images/img_032.png)

### filter

The filter class can be used to filter using a filter function call to a sequence. Its initialization signature can be viewed by inputting filter() and pressing shift ⇧ and tab ↹:

![img_033](./images/img_033.png)

For example the lambda expression:

```
positive_filter = lambda num: num > 0
```

Can be mapped to the following sequence:

```
nums = (-2, -1, 0, 1, 2)
```

Using:

```
forward = filter(positive_filter, nums)
```

![img_034](./images/img_034.png)

This filter instance is an iterator that once again displays on the Variable Explorer with a length of 1 as it displays 1 value at a time, which in this case is a value in the sequence that has a positive_filter function call of True:

![img_035](./images/img_035.png)

When next is called, the value is the next value in the sequence nums where the positive_filter function returns True: 

```
next(forward)
```

![img_036](./images/img_036.png)

```
next(forward)
```

![img_037](./images/img_037.png)

All the filtered values given by the iterator can be consumed by casting to a tuple:

```
tuple(filter(positive_filter, nums))
```

![img_038](./images/img_038.png)

## itertools module

The itertools module contains a number of other useful iterator classes which supplement those from builtins.

The itertools module can be imported using:

```
import itertools
```

Its identifiers can be viewed by typing in itertools. followed by a tab ↹:

![img_039](./images/img_039.png)

Most of these are classes.

### islice

Supposing the following tuple is created:

```
nums = tuple(range(10))
```

![img_040](./images/img_040.png)

It can be viewed on the Variable Explorer. The tuple was cast from a range instance which had a default start of 0 and step of 1 so its index and values match. It can be examined in the Variable Explorer:

![img_041](./images/img_041.png)

![img_042](./images/img_042.png)

Indexing and slicing are typically carried out using square brackets:

```
nums[0]
nums[1:5]
```

![img_043](./images/img_043.png)

The slice function can also be explicitly used. The slice function has input arguments that are consistent with the range class. Its input arguments can be viewed by inputting slice() and pressing shift ⇧ and tab ↹:

![img_044](./images/img_044.png)

Its input arguments are of the type int:

* It can take in a single stop input argument. 

* Alternatively it can take a start and stop input argument.

* Alternatively it can take a start, stop and step input argument.

The input arguments are followed by a / indicating they are to be provided positionally only. If the start is not supplied it is assumed to be 0 and if the step is assumed to be 1. The same slice as before can be examined:

```
slice(1, 5)
nums[slice(1, 5)]
```

![img_045](./images/img_045.png)

The iterator slice islice class returns an iterator instead of a slice that retains the same data type as the original iterable. Its initialization signature can be viewed by inputting itertools.islice() and pressing shift ⇧ and tab ↹:

![img_046](./images/img_046.png)

It requires an iterable or iterator as the first positional input argument and the subsequent input arguments match that of slice:

```
forward = itertools.islice(nums, 1, 5)
forward
```

![img_047](./images/img_047.png)

This islice instance is an iterator that once again displays on the Variable Explorer with a length of 1 as it displays 1 value at a time, which in this case is the value which came fro  slicing the original sequence:

![img_048](./images/img_048.png)

```
next(forward)
next(forward)
```

![img_049](./images/img_049.png)

The iterator slice islice class can also take an iterator as a first input argument. When it does the iterator slice is linked to the iterator:

```
forward = iter(range(10))
forward_slice = itertools.islice(forward, 1, 5)
```

This can be seen by casting forward_slice to a tuple and then casting forward to a tuple:

```
tuple(forward_slice)
tuple(forward)
```

![img_050](./images/img_050.png)

Notice that when the values in forward_slice were consumed by casting forward_slice into a tuple, they were also consumed in forward, which is why they do not display in forward when forward is consumed by casting into a tuple.

Alternatively if all the values were consumed in forward, they would also be consumed in forward_slice: 

```
forward = iter(range(10))
forward_slice = itertools.islice(forward, 1, 5)
tuple(forward)
tuple(forward_slice)
```

![img_051](./images/img_051.png)

### tee

The tee function can be used to return a tuple of n independent iterators. Its name comes from the tee junction used for example in plumbing to split a water stream:

![img_052](./images/img_052.png)

Its docstring can be viewed by inputting itertools.tee() and pressing shift ⇧ and tab ↹. It takes in an iterable or iterator as an input argument, and the number of independent iterators. A / is followed by these input arguments so they must be supplied positionally:

![img_053](./images/img_053.png)

For example the iterator forward can be split into two independent iterators and unpacking the tuple using tuple unpacking:

```
forward = iter(range(10))
forward1, forward2 = itertools.tee(forward, 2)
```

![img_054](./images/img_054.png)

These show up on the Variable Explorer:

![img_055](./images/img_055.png)

These can be shown to be independent by looking at the following. Although forward1 and forward2 are independent, they are still related to the original object forward. Essentially forward becomes equivalent to the pipeline that is furthest along (most exhausted):

```
next(forward2)
tuple(forward1)
tuple(forward)
tuple(forward2)
```

![img_056](./images/img_056.png)

This can be seen in this example:

```
forward = iter(range(10))
forward1, forward2 = itertools.tee(forward, 2)
next(forward2)
next(forward2)
next(forward2)
next(forward1)
tuple(forward)
```

![img_057](./images/img_057.png)

### chain

The itertools.chain class can be used to chain two or more iterables together. Its initialization signature can be viewed by inputting itertools.chain() and pressing shift ⇧ and tab ↹. The input arguments are *iterables indicating that a variable number of iterables or iterators can be chained. The / indicates that these must be provided as positional input arguments:

![img_058](./images/img_058.png)

For example:

```
forward1 = iter((1, 2, 3))
forward2 = iter(('a', 'b', 'c'))
forward = itertools.chain(forward1, forward2)
```

![img_059](./images/img_059.png)

These show up on the Variable Explorer:

![img_060](./images/img_060.png)

The chain iterator essentially chains the iterators creating one larger iterator. This large iterator is still linked with the original iterators. Using next on one of the original iterators forward1 or forward2 will exhaust it from the chain forward. Likewise using next on the chain forward will exhaust the value from the corresponding original iterator:

```
next(forward)
next(forward2)
next(forward)
next(forward1)
next(forward)
```

![img_061](./images/img_061.png)

### repeat

The itertools.repeat class can be used to repeat an object for a specified or unspecified number of times. Its initialization signature can be viewed by inputting itertools.repeat() and pressing shift ⇧ and tab ↹. The input arguments is object and times is optional. The / indicates that these must be provided as positional input arguments:

![img_062](./images/img_062.png)

For example:

```
forward = itertools.repeat('hello', 3)
forward
```

![img_063](./images/img_063.png)

This shows up on the Variable Explorer:

![img_064](./images/img_064.png)

When next is called on the iterator, the repeated object 'hello' will display:

```
next(forward)
next(forward)
next(forward)
```

![img_065](./images/img_065.png)

This iterator will be exhausted and show StopIteration if next is used again:

```
next(forward)
```

![img_066](./images/img_066.png)

If times is not specified an iterator of infinite repeat values will be created:

```
forward = itertools.repeat('hello')
forward
```

![img_067](./images/img_067.png)

Care should be taken when attempting to cast this to a sequence such as a tuple or to use it in a for loop as it will attempt to create a sequence that is infinite in length or an infinite loop respectively.

```
import itertools
tuple(itertools.repeat('hello'))
```

![img_069](./images/img_069.png)

```
import itertools
forward = itertools.repeat('hello')
for word in forward:
    print(word)
    
    
```

![img_068](./images/img_068.png)

### cycle

The itertools.cycle class can be used to repeat a cycle of objects indefinitely. A common use case is the cycling of files in a folder in an application with a next button, once the last file has been accessed, instead of the next button being greyed out, it can cycle back to the first file. Its initialization signature can be viewed by inputting itertools.cycle() and pressing shift ⇧ and tab ↹. The input arguments is iterable. The / indicates that these must be provided as positional input arguments:

![img_070](./images/img_070.png)

```
colors = ('red', 'green', 'blue')
forward = itertools.cycle(colors)
forward
```

![img_071](./images/img_071.png)

This shows up on the Variable Explorer:

![img_072](./images/img_072.png)

The iterator can indefinitely cycled through:

```
next(forward)
next(forward)
next(forward)
next(forward)
```

![img_073](./images/img_073.png)

Care should once again be taken when attempting to cast this to a sequence such as a tuple or to use it in a for loop as it will attempt to create a sequence that is infinite in length or an infinite loop respectively.

### count

The itertools.count class can be used to create an iterator that is similar to a range iterator. Its initialization signature can be viewed by inputting itertools.count() and pressing shift ⇧ and tab ↹. The input arguments are start and step which have the default values 0 and 1. Notice the emission of stop, indicating that this iterator will count indefinitely:

```
forward = itertools.count()
forward
```

![img_074](./images/img_074.png)

This shows up on the Variable Explorer:

![img_075](./images/img_075.png)

The iterator can be used to count upwards indefinitely:

```
next(forward)
next(forward)
next(forward)
next(forward)
```

![img_076](./images/img_076.png)

Care should once again be taken when attempting to cast this to a sequence such as a tuple or to use it in a for loop as it will attempt to create a sequence that is infinite in length or an infinite loop respectively. The count iterator can be used with an infinite while loop. A nested if code block can be configured with a condition and an associated else code block can be configured to break out the infinite while loop. For example:

```
while True:
    num = next(forward)
    if num < 10:
        print(num)
    else:
        break
        
        
```

![img_077](./images/img_077.png)

### accumulate

The itertools.accumulate class can be used to create an iterator that is similar to one created using map by default mapping the addition binary operator to the iterable returning the accumulation along the sequence. Its initialization signature can be viewed by inputting itertools.accumulate() and pressing shift ⇧ and tab ↹. The input arguments are the iterable. There is an optional func which defaults to the addition operator and  initial input argument which defaults to None:

![img_078](./images/img_078.png)

```
nums = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4)
forward = itertools.accumulate(nums)
forward
```

![img_079](./images/img_079.png)

This shows up on the Variable Explorer:

![img_080](./images/img_080.png)

When next is used, the first value in the sequence 0 is returned:

```
next(forward)
```

![img_081](./images/img_081.png)

When next is used, the previous accumulation 0 is added with the second value in the iterator 1. Both of these are supplied to the binary operator add:

```
next(forward)
```

![img_082](./images/img_082.png)

When next is used, the previous accumulation 1 is added with the third value in the iterator 2. Both of these are supplied to the binary operator add:

```
next(forward)
```

![img_083](./images/img_083.png)

This continues until all the values in the sequence are exhausted. If the iterator is cast into a tuple, it has the same length as the original sequence:

```
tuple(itertools.accumulate(nums))
```

![img_084](./images/img_084.png)

If an initial value is specified, this increases the length by 1:

![img_085](./images/img_085.png)

The operator module contains the binary functions which can be assigned to the func input argument of the itertools.accumulate class. It can be imported using:

```
import operator
```

Its identifiers can be viewed by inputting operator. followed by a tab ↹:

![img_086](./images/img_086.png)

A multiplication accumulation can for example be computed using:

```
nums = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
tuple(itertools.accumulate(nums, func=operator.mul))
```

![img_087](./images/img_087.png)

Note that nums is updated to remove the 0, otherwise all the values will be multiplied by 0 giving 0 for each value in the multiplication accumulation respectively.

### starmap

If the function powered is assigned using a lambda expression:

```
powered = lambda num, power: num ** power
```

There are two input arguments and one return value. A tuple of the same length 2:

```
args = (2, 3)
```

Can be unpacked to the 2 input arguments in the function call:

```
powered(*args)
```

![img_088](./images/img_088.png)

The itertools.starmap class can be used to create an iterator that is similar to one created using map. Instead of mapping a function to a sequence where each value in the sequence is supplied as a single input argument for the function call. The function is mapped to a sequence of equally lengthed tuples and tuple unpacking is used for each tuple supplying multiple input arguments for each function call. The initialization signature can be seen by inputting itertools.starmap() and pressing shift ⇧ and tab ↹. The input arguments are the function and iterable (of tuples). These are followed by a / indicating they must be supplied positionally only:

![img_089](./images/img_089.png)

For example args can be created using:

```
args = tuple(zip(range(10), itertools.repeat(2)))
```

And can be viewed on the Variable Explorer:

![img_090](./images/img_090.png)

![img_091](./images/img_091.png)

For simplicity, the second value in each tuple is a constant 2. A starmap iterator can now be created:

```
forward = itertools.starmap(powered, args)
forward
```

![img_092](./images/img_092.png)

This displays in the Variable Explorer:

![img_093](./images/img_093.png)

Using next will extract the tuple providing the input arguments for the function call:

```
next(forward)
next(forward)
next(forward)
```

![img_094](./images/img_094.png)

This iterator can be cast into a tuple to in this case compute the following squared values:

```
tuple(itertools.starmap(powered, args))
```

![img_095](./images/img_095.png)

### zip_longest

The itertools.zip_longest class can be used to zip two or more collections together. Unlike zip which stops zipping once the shortest sequence has been exhausted, itertools.zip_longest will continue zipping until the longest sequence is exhaused. None values will be supplied when the shorter sequence is exhausted. Its initialization signature can be viewed by inputting itertools.zip_longest() and pressing shift ⇧ and tab ↹:

![img_096](./images/img_096.png)

The example used with the zip class can be reused:

```
names = ('red', 'green', 'blue', 'yellow')
keys = ('r', 'g', 'b')
values = ('#FF0000', '#00FF00', '#0000FF')
forward = itertools.zip_longest(names, keys, values)
```

![img_097](./images/img_097.png)

This displays in the Variable Explorer:

![img_098](./images/img_098.png)

Using next will display the tuple of zipped items. The iterator will be consumed when at the last item of the longest sequence

```
next(forward)
next(forward)
next(forward)
next(forward)
```

![img_099](./images/img_099.png)

### pairwise

The itertools.pairwise class can be used to create tuple pairs from neighbouring values in a sequence. Its initialization signature can be viewed by inputting itertools.pairwise() and pressing shift ⇧ and tab ↹. It has a single input argument iterable which is follwoed by a / indicarting it is to be supplied positionally only:

![img_100](./images/img_100.png)

For example:

```
letters = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd')

forward = itertools.pairwise(letters)
forward
```

![img_101](./images/img_101.png)

This displays on the Variable Explorer:

![img_102](./images/img_102.png)

Using next will display the tuple of paired items.

```
next(forward)
```

![img_103](./images/img_103.png)

```
next(forward)
```

![img_104](./images/img_104.png)

Casting to a tuple will display all the pairs, the tuple will have the length one less that the original sequence:

```
tuple(itertools.pairwise(letters))
```

![img_105](./images/img_105.png)

### filterfalse

The itertools.filterfalse class acts inversely to the filter. Its initialization signature can be viewed by inputting itertools.filterfalse() and pressing shift ⇧ and tab ↹:

![img_106](./images/img_106.png)

For example if the same lambda expression is used as before:

```
positive_filter = lambda num: num > 0
```

Can be mapped to the following sequence:

```
nums = (-2, -1, 0, 1, 2)
```

Using:

```
forward = itertools.filterfalse(positive_filter, nums)
```

![img_107](./images/img_107.png)

This filter instance is an iterator that once again displays on the Variable Explorer with a length of 1 as it displays 1 value at a time, which in this case is a value in the sequence that has a positive_filter function call of False:

![img_108](./images/img_108.png)

When next is called, the value is the next value in the sequence nums where the positive_filter function returns False: 

```
next(forward)
```

![img_109](./images/img_109.png)

```
next(forward)
```

![img_110](./images/img_110.png)

All the filtered values given by the iterator can be consumed by casting to a tuple:

```
tuple(itertools.filterfalse(positive_filter, nums))
tuple(filter(positive_filter, nums))
```

### dropwhile

The itertools.dropwhile class will drop each item in an iterable until a predicate is taken to be False. i.e. the first False acts as a trigger point. Its initialization signature can be viewed by inputting itertools.dropwhile() and pressing shift ⇧ and tab ↹. It has the input arguments predicate and iterable. These are followed by a / which indicates the input arguments are to be provided positionally only:

![img_112](./images/img_112.png)

For example the following tuple of letters can be the iterable and the predicate can be a lambda expression that is False unless the letter is 'd':

```
letters = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h')
forward = itertools.dropwhile(lambda x: x != 'd', letters)
forward
```

![img_113](./images/img_113.png)

This displays on the Variable Explorer:

![img_114](./images/img_114.png)

When next is called, the value at the first occurance of a False condition is returned: 

```
next(forward)
```

![img_115](./images/img_115.png)

All subsequent values in the sequence are called with successive next calls:

```
next(forward)
```

![img_116](./images/img_116.png)

This can be seen more clearly by casting to a tuple:

![img_117](./images/img_117.png)

### takewhile

The itertools.takewhile class is the inverse of the itertools.dropwhile class. It will take each item in an iterable until a predicate is taken to be False. i.e. the first False acts as a trigger point and all values dropping this value and all subsequent items. Its initialization signature can be viewed by inputting itertools.takewhile() and pressing shift ⇧ and tab ↹. It has the input arguments predicate and iterable. These are followed by a / which indicates the input arguments are to be provided positionally only:

![img_118](./images/img_118.png)

The same example can be viewed as before:

```
letters = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h')
forward = itertools.takewhile(lambda x: x != 'd', letters)
forward
```

![img_119](./images/img_119.png)

This displays in the Variable Explorer:

![img_120](./images/img_120.png)

When next is called, the next value in the sequence is returned unless the condition is False, at this point the iterator is exhausted: 

```
next(forward)
next(forward)
next(forward)
next(forward)
```

![img_121](./images/img_121.png)

The two classes are complementary to each toher and this can be seen when casting to a tuple:

```
letters = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h')
tuple(itertools.takewhile(lambda x: x != 'd', letters))
tuple(itertools.dropwhile(lambda x: x != 'd', letters))
```

![img_122](./images/img_122.png)

### compress

The itertools.compress class can be used to compress data using a selector. Its initialization signature can be viewed by inputting itertools.compress() and pressing shift ⇧ and tab ↹. It has the input arguments data and selectors:

![img_123](./images/img_123.png)

For example, the data can be the tuple instance letters and the selector can be the tuple instance conditions. Both of these have the same length:

```
letters = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f')
conditions = (True, True, False, False, True, True)
```

The compressed iterator is therefore:

```
forward = itertools.compress(letters, conditions)
forward
```

![img_124](./images/img_124.png)

This displays in the variable explorer:

![img_125](./images/img_125.png)

When next is called, the next value in the sequence is returned where the selector is True: 

```
next(forward)
```

![img_126](./images/img_126.png)

```
next(forward)
```

![img_127](./images/img_127.png)

```
next(forward)
```

![img_128](./images/img_128.png)

This can be seen more clearly when casting to a tuple:

```
tuple(itertools.compress(letters, conditions))
```

![img_129](./images/img_129.png)

### combinations

The itertools.combinations class can be used to display the unique combinations available from items in an iterable using a r-length. This is best visualised pictorially. For example if the iterable has three color circles and a r-length of 2. The combinations would look like:

![img_130](./images/img_130.png)

Its initialization signature can be viewed by inputting itertools.combinations() and pressing shift ⇧ and tab ↹. It has the input arguments iterable and r:

![img_131](./images/img_131.png)

The example above can be created using:

```
colors = ('c', 'y', 'm')
forward = itertools.combinations(colors, 2)
forward
tuple(forward)
```

![img_132](./images/img_132.png)

### combinations_with_replacement

The itertools.combinations\_with\_replacement class can be used to display the unique combinations available from items in an iterable using a r-length when the items in the iterable can be duplicated. This is best visualised pictorially. For example if the iterable has three color circles and a r-length of 2. The combinations with replacement would look like:

![img_133](./images/img_133.png)

Its initialization signature can be viewed by inputting itertools.itertools.combinations_with_replacement() and pressing shift ⇧ and tab ↹. It has the input arguments iterable and r:

![img_134](./images/img_134.png)

The example above can be created using:

```
colors = ('c', 'y', 'm')
forward = itertools.combinations_with_replacement(colors, 2)
forward
tuple(forward)
```

![img_135](./images/img_135.png)

### permutations

The itertools.permutations class can be used to display the unique permutations available from items in an iterable using a r-length. In a combination, the order of the values in the tuple representing the combination doesn't matter. In a permutation this order matters. This is best visualised pictorially. For example if the iterable has three color circles and a r-length of 2. The combinations would look like:

![img_136](./images/img_136.png)

Its initialization signature can be viewed by inputting itertools.permutations() and pressing shift ⇧ and tab ↹. It has the input arguments iterable and r:

![img_137](./images/img_137.png)

The example above can be created using:

```
colors = ('c', 'y', 'm')
forward = itertools.permutations(colors, 2)
forward
tuple(forward)
```

![img_138](./images/img_138.png)

### product

The itertools.product class can be used to display the unique permutations with replacement available from items in an iterable using a r-length. This is best visualised pictorially. For example if the iterable has three color circles and a r-length of 2. The product would look like:

![img_139](./images/img_139.png)

Its initialization signature can be viewed by inputting itertools.product() and pressing shift ⇧ and tab ↹. It uses different input arguments to the init signatures of the similar classes. It has a variable number of input argument *iterables and the repeat keyword input argument:

![img_140](./images/img_140.png)

When a single iterable is supplied and repeat is assigned to the previously used r-length, this calculates the permutations with replacement:

```
colors = ('c', 'y', 'm')
forward = itertools.product(colors, repeat=2)
forward
tuple(forward)
```

![img_141](./images/img_141.png)

If multiple iterables of equal length are supplied, the product creates an iterator. When next is called a tuple is returned which takes a value from each of the sequences:

```
letters = ('a', 'b', 'c')
nums = (1, 2, 3)

forward = itertools.product(letters, nums)
forward

tuple(forward)
```

![img_142](./images/img_142.png)

If multiple iterables of equal length are supplied, and repeat is assigned to 2, the the tuple returned has two values from each sequence. For example:

```
forward = itertools.product(letters, nums, repeat=2)
forward

tuple(forward)
```

![img_143](./images/img_143.png)

### groupby

The itertools.groupby class can be used to group repeating elements in an iterable together using an optional key. Its initialization signature can be viewed by inputting itertools.groupby() and pressing shift ⇧ and tab ↹. It has the positional input argument iterable and optional keyword input argument key:

![img_144](./images/img_144.png)

In the simplest case, there is no key and therefore each unique value in the iterable is automatically taken to be a key. Each group is a collection of identical values that correspond to this key. The following tuple can be examined:

```
values = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'a')
```

In order to be grouped, the iterable must be sorted:

```
sorted(values)
```

And the variable name values can be reassigned:

```
values = tuple(sorted(values))
values
```

![img_145](./images/img_145.png)

An iterator of three groups can be created using:

```
forward = itertools.groupby(values)
forward
```

![img_146](./images/img_146.png)

This displays on the Variable Explorer:

![img_147](./images/img_147.png)

When next is used on the iterator, a tuple is displayed containing the key in the first position and an iterator of these grouped values in the second position:

```
next(forward)
next(forward)
next(forward)
```

![img_148](./images/img_148.png)

Recreating the iterator, each tuple can be unpacked and the key and group can be examined. To view all the elements in the group iterator, it can be cast into a tuple:

```
forward = itertools.groupby(values)
forward

key, group = next(forward)
key
tuple(group)

key, group = next(forward)
key
tuple(group)

key, group = next(forward)
key
tuple(group)
```

![img_149](./images/img_149.png)

The return value of the itertools.groupby class is an iterator of nested 2 elements tuples which can be conceptualised as an item containing a key and iterator. A dictionary mapping can be populated using a for loop:

```
forward = itertools.groupby(values)

mapping = {}

for item in forward:
    key = item[0]
    group = item[1]
    mapping[key] = tuple(group)


mapping
```

![img_150](./images/img_150.png)

Now supposing the following tuple of values was created:

```
values = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'A', 'A', 'a', 'B', 'b', 'C', 'a')
```

Sorting it gives all the lower case letters first followed by all the upper case letters as the ordinal values of the lower case letters is smaller than that of the upper case letters:

```
sorted(values)
```

And the variable name values can be reassigned:

```
values = tuple(sorted(values))
```

![img_151](./images/img_151.png)

Now itertools.groupby can be used with a key. This key can be assigned to a lamba expression which uses the str method islower to check to see if a value is a upper case str i.e. the lambda expression returns False or is a lower case str i.e. the lambda expression returns True.

```
forward = itertools.groupby(values, 
                            key=lambda x: x.islower())
forward
```

This can be seen by calling next on the groupby iterator:

```
next(forward)
next(forward)
```

![img_152](./images/img_152.png)

Recreating the iterator, a similar dictionary can be configured to before:

```
forward = itertools.groupby(values, 
                            key=lambda x: x.islower())

mapping = {}

for item in forward:
    if item[0] == False:
        key = 'upper'
    else:
        key = 'lower'
    group = item[1]
    mapping[key] = tuple(group)
    
    
mapping
```
